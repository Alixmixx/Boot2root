In this walkthrough, we are going to use the fact that we write files in the /forum/template_c directory to perform a
SUID-based exploit and catch a reverse shell, all that from the phpmyadmin interface.

SUID is a special permission in Unix-like operating systems that allows a user to execute a program with the permissions of the file's owner, rather than the permissions of the user who is running the program


Steps:
    Create a custom payload with a SUID exploit in C, embeded in a php script, inside of a sql request.
    The SQL will create a php script able to write our c file in tmp and compile it, and the execute it.
    This will create a new user with root privileges
    Then a other php script will be upload, and he will give us a reverse shell. 


In our case the steps are:

Create a Custom Payload:
    Find and custom a C program with a SUID exploit.
    Embed the C program within a PHP script.
    Incorporate the PHP script into an SQL request.

Execute SQL to Create a PHP Script:
    Use the SQL request to generate a PHP script capable of writing the C file in the temporary directory (/tmp), compiling it, and executing the compiled binary.
    This action results in the creation of a new user with root privileges.

Upload Another PHP Script:
    Upload an additional PHP script designed to provide a reverse shell.
    Listen on our machine.

Obtain a Reverse Shell:
    Execute the uploaded PHP script to establish a reverse shell connection.

We are now root on the reverse shell
