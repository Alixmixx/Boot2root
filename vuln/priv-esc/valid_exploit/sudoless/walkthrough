For this exploit, we are going to use the buffer overflow of the exploit_me program and the fact that the suid is root to
allow the zaz user to execute the less command with sudo rights. 

We are going to find the offset with a pattern generator. With gdb we get the address etc..

We are going to inject a custom shellcode that will had:

    zaz ALL=(ALL:ALL) /bin/less

To the /etc/sudoer.d/README. This will be more discret than putting in directly inside the sudoer file, and will only give us access to one binary which will be less suspcious is a possible priv-esc. In fact, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or ma
Once we had this line, we can use:

    sudo less <file>

With the use of less with sudo privileges, there is a possible priv-esc. In fact, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access, due to the fact that you can run commands inside of the less preview

    sudo less <file>

    !/bin/bash

    !done  (press RETURN)
